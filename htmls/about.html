           <h3>User Guide</h3>
         <p>
         The user discovers pieces of evidence through exploring the campus map. When the user has discovered every piece of evidence in a building new areas can be accessed. Unlocked evidence can be accessed later on the inventory page, where it is arranged chronologically.

           <h3>About</h3>
           
		   
		   <p>TZD is a collaborative final project assembled by a sub-group of the MSc Interactive Digital Media in Trinity College Dublin for the academic year of 2013/14. The aim of the class as a whole was to explore the concept “Reflections of Trinity” through a distinct assortment of digital media. Team TZD focused on examining the idea of “reflections” through a web based interactive narrative. We wanted to incorporate the idea of reflection in terms of looking back upon events past. The history of trinity is well documented so Team TCD decided to focus on a futuristic fictional narrative in which the user explores the Trinity campus and pieces together the story. Through assembling the story the user encounters a rich array of media, created by Team TZD in order to bring the narrative to life. The futuristic user interface and sombre audio landscape immerses the user in the fictional narrative, while evoking a varied range of emotions throughout the journey.  </p>
